# Why study functional programming?
1. Functional languages teach you that *programming* transcends *programming in a language* (assuming you have only programmed in imperative languages)
2. Functional languages *predict the future*
3. Functional languages are *sometimes* used in industry
4. Functional languages are *elegant*
-----------------------------------------
# Analogy: studying a foreign language
- Learn about another culture; incorporate aspects into your own life
- Shed preconceptions and prejudices about others
- Understand your native language better
-----------------------------------------
# Alan J. Perlis (1922-1990)
- "A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing."
- First recipient of the Turing Award for his "*influence in the area of advanced programming techniques and compiler construction*"

# Functional languages predict the future
## Garbage collection
- Java (1995)
- LISP (1958)
## Generics
- Java 5 (2004)
- ML (1990)
## Higher-order functions
- C# 3.0 (2007)
- Java 8 (2014)
- LISP (1958)
## Type inference
- C++ 11 (2011)
- Java 7 (2011: initial release)
- Java 8 (2014: improved)
- ML (1990)
## What's next?
- Pattern matching (added in Rust recently)
-----------------------------------------
# Functional languages in the real world
- Java 8 (Oracle)
- F#, C# 3.0, LINQ (Microsoft)
- Scala (Twitter, FourSquare, LinkedIn)
- Haskell (Facebook, Barclays, AT&T)
- Erlang (Facebook, Amazon, T-Mobile)
- OCaml (Facebook, Bloomberg, Citrix, Jane Street)
## Note
- Cornell CS (et al.) require functional programming for your *education*, not to get you a job
-----------------------------------------
# Albert Einstein (1879-1955)
- "Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything one learned in school."
-----------------------------------------
# Elegance
## Do aesthetics matter?
### YES!
### Who reads code?
- Machines
- Humans
### Elegant code
- Easier to read and maintain
- Might (not) be easier to write
-----------------------------------------
