# OCaml
- A pretty good language for writing beautiful programs
## What does OCaml stand for?
- O = Objective, Caml = not important (Categorical Abstract Machine Language)
- ML is a family of languages; originally the "meta-language"
-----------------------------------------
# OCaml is awesome
## Immutable programming
- Variable's values cannot destructively be changed; makes reasoning about program easier!
## Algebraic datatypes and pattern matching
- Makes definition and manipulation of complex data structures easy to express
## First-class functions
- Functions can be passed around like ordinary values
## Static type-checking
- Reduce number of run-time errors
## Automatic type inference
- No burden to write down types of every single variable
## Parametric polymorphism
- Enables construction of abstractions that work across many data types
## Garbage collection
- Automated memory management eliminates many run-time errors
## Modules
- Advanced system for structuring large systems
### But no language is perfect...
-----------------------------------------
# Languages are tools
- There's no universally perfect tool
- There's no universally perfect language
## OCaml is good for this course because:
- Good mix of functional and imperative features
- Relatively easy to reason about meaning of programs
## But OCaml isn't perfect
- There will be features you miss from language X
- There will be annoyances based on your expectations
- Keep an open mind, try to have fun
