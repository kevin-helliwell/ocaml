# Five aspects of learning a PL
1. **Syntax**: How do you write language constructs?
2. **Semantics**: What do programs mean? (Type checking, evaluation rules)
3. **Idioms**: What are typical patterns for using language features to express your computation?
4. **Libraries**: What facilities does the language (or a third-party project) provide as "standard"? (E.g., file access, data structures)
5. **Tools**: What do language implementations provide to make your job easier? (E.g., top-level, debugger, GUI editor, etc.)
## Importance
- All are essential for good programmers to understand
- Breaking a new PL down into these pieces make it easier to learn
-----------------------------------------
# Our focus
## We focus on semantics and idioms for OCaml
- **Semantics** is like a meta-tool: it will help you learn languages
- **Idioms** will make you a better programmer in those languages
## Libraries and tools are a secondary focus
- Throughout your career you'll learn new ones on the job every year
## Syntax is almost always boring
- A fact to learn, like "Cornell was founded in 1865"
- People obsess over subjective preferences (yawn)
- Class rule: **We don't complain about syntax**
