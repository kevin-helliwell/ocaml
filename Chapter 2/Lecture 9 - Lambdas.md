# Anonymous function expression
- Syntax: `fun x1 ... xn -> e`
## Evaluation
- **A function is a value**: no further computation to do
- In particular, body `e` is not evaluated until function is applied
# Lambda
- Anonymous functions a.k.a. *lambda expressions*
- Math notation: `Î»x . e`
- The lambda means "what follows is an anonymous function"
# Lambda (cont.)
- Python
- Java 8
- A popular PL blog (*Lambda the Ultimate*)
- Lambda style (*Gangnam Style* parody)
# Functions are values
## Can use them anywhere we use values
- Functions can **take** functions as arguments
- Functions can **return** functions as results
- This is an incredibly powerful language feature!
